# Overview 

This repository documents two different websites I have built and deployed:

1. **My Personal WordPress Website** (Hosted on AWS Lightsail)  
2. **Custom Website** (Hosted on Azure)

Each project has its own folder with a detailed `README.md` explaining its setup, design, and deployment process.
